		THE BACKEND BOARD SHOULD:
		-USE -1 FOR MINES
		-USE 0 FOR BLANKS
		
		THE FRONTEND BOARD:
		- IS A STRING[][]
		-USES X FOR SUPPOSED MINE
		- USE BLANK FOR THE HIDDEN CELLS
		- SHOULD HAVE THE ROW/COL NUMBERS AROUND THE BOARD
		- THESE LABELS ARE JUST PRINTS. NOT PART OF THE ARRAY
		
		SCROLL DOWN FOR PRINT BOARD METHOD
		I INSTANTIATED BOARD AND PLAYER BOARD IN THE PLAY() METHOD
		BOARD[0][0] = 1 FOR NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT MADE THE BACKEND BOARD YET
		
		RUN YOUR CODE AT:
		MY CLASS AT GabrielMinesweeperBoard.createBoard(row, col); IN MY CODE
		YOUR CREATEBOARD METHOD WILL CREATE THE REST OF THE BOARD BASED ON THE FIRST INPUT OF THE USER
		ROW AND COL PARAMETERS ARE JUST INT
		
		WHEN YOU HAVE MADE THE CREATEBOARD METHOD, LET ME KNOW. 
		I WILL UNCOMMENT MY FUNCTION CALL : GabrielMinesweeperBoard.createBoard(row, col);
		BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE WOULD BE AN ERROR SINCE YOU HAVEN'T CREATED IT YET
